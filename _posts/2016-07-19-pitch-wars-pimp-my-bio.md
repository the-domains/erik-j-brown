# Pitch Wars Pimp My Bio

This is my new site and it's automatically generated by the AI controlling this site. I know what you're thinking...

<article style=""><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/cb55409f36c069effcf94cee8f37e2eb6d089aa8.gif" /></article>

Yes, the design is all AI, however the writing is all me. So let's start at my bio...
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f4582dce-021b-4eea-a76a-d56880fd10cd.gif)

My name is Erik J. Brown and I am a writer based out of Philadelphia, PA. I live here with my fantastic boyfriend, Michael, and our Lovecraftian monster disguised as a Shiba Inu, named Charlie. Here's Charlie:
![See? Part Lovecraftian beast... look at that tongue.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/18a1df12-c88e-42be-8f1b-2e3c74d2920b.jpg)

I know, adorable right!?

You'll get to know him better later, but first, more about me and my writing style.

## MY STYLE:

First and foremost _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ is probably the biggest influence on my writing.

<article style=""><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0c4b4d1fbca40fe8c7694901ec68cdd4d944fa3a.gif" /></article>

Not just the snarky dialogue (which yes that's there too), but also the darker aspects of Buffy. I also take some of my darker horror elements from Stephen King.

When I was in third grade I was a bit of a troublemaker. In order to make me pay attention in class my teacher developed this point system. At the end of the week if I got enough points after each lesson, my mother agreed to reward me with anything I wanted.

One of those times I chose to go to the bookstore and pick out _any _book I wanted. I chose The Shining by Stephen King.

I was a peculiar child.

That's when I started writing, by the way. It wasn't all blood and guts back then. In fact, the first short story I ever wrote told the brilliantly original tale of a money tree growing in our backyard. I forget all the magical logistics of growing said money tree (there was a distinct lack of Money Tree Security as well) but it was all in order to help my mother pay the bills. This was met with praise by my teacher and she hung it up in the hallway during Parent/Teacher night.

My mother maintains that it was the best thing I've ever written.

While it is exceedingly sad to have peaked at such a young age I've managed to persevere and continue writing. I am currently a contributor over at [HorrorFreakNews.com][0] and this is my second year participating in Pitch Wars.

## MY BOOK:

This year I am presenting my YA horror novel: _Lovecraft Will Tear Us Apart _(title subject to change, the original title was _Wendigo Your Own Way _but I was told to try something darker).

Alexandra Aguilar is a typical girl, she has boyfriend troubles, school troubles, her recently deceased father was apparently a serial killer in his spare time, and after being nearly mauled to death by a monster her arm has begun shifting into tentacles. Now Alex, with the help of her best friend Cody, has to solve the murders, clear her father's name, _and_ deal with these pesky tentacles. Life's hard.

It's one part Buffy...

One part Veronica Mars...

And just a dash of Lovecraft...

The good news is, I take criticism like a champ. I'm here to make my book better and I'm willing to work my ass off to do it.
