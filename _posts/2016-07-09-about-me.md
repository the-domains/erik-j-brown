# About Me:
![Erik J. Brown](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/19bcca52-36ad-4367-b7d6-ada27be579fa.jpg)

First and foremost, a little bit about me:

My name is Erik J. Brown, first of my name. I live in Philadelphia with my fantastic boyfriend and a Lovecraftian monster disguised as a Shiba Inu named Charlie. 

I write. Mainly about things that go bump in the night or try to kill you when you least suspect it... But we have fun!

Recently I've realized that if I was around in the 70's I would have been a HUGE fan of disco... and I'm not embarrassed by that fact.
