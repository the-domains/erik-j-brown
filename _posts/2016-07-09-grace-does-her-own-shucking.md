# Grace Does Her Own Shucking...

Grace Jones and the art of ![Grace Does her Own Shucking.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1c936196-a482-4e88-9a69-1ed79e8b6880.jpg)

I have a mantra that I suggest you use any time you need to overcome an obstacle or are feeling nervous, scared, or just hopeless. Quite some time ago I discovered that Grace Jones includes a rider with any performance contracts she signs. Included in the rider, among many other things, is this: "2 Dozen Findeclare or Colchester Oysters on ice (unopened)" then in parentheses afterwards are these words that I repeat whenever I just need a moment:

"Grace does her own shucking."

Grace does her own shucking.

Like "Water off a duck's back," Grace does her own shucking.

If life gets hard and you don't think you can go on anymore just remember, Grace does her own shucking.
