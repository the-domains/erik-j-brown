# Living on the Grid...
![I've given my Grid crabs...](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5692e334794a40534c97f2cdc5ba1bf3f0c3a397.jpg)

It's finally happened.

I am on the damn Grid.

The Grid is an artificial intelligence based web design site. Basically the more I create and update the more it changes my site. I've been waiting QUITE some time for this to finally be available to me... so I guess I had better start fiddling around.

First off, Grid, I give you CRABS.

Wait... How the hell do I add my Twitter account to this?
