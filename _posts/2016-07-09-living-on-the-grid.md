# Living on the Grid...
![I've given my Grid crabs...](https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e49c421e188a8ed7163e17568145fa1c/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=2445&cropwidth=2770&degrees=0&input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fdcdd2c6e-9847-420b-93c3-0f4736aa47e8.jpg&x=0&y=0)

It's finally happened. 

I am on the damn Grid. 

The Grid is an artificial intelligence based web design site. Basically the more I create and update the more it changes my site. I've been waiting QUITE some time for this to finally be available to me... so I guess I had better start fiddling around. 

First off, Grid, I give you CRABS.

Wait... How the hell do I add my Twitter account to this?
