<p>I know, adorable right!?</p><p>You’ll get to know him better later.</p><p>but first...</p><h2>Two Truths and a Lie!</h2><p>Two of the following statements are true. One is a lie. BUT WHICH?</p><p>-I once took the bus to the hospital in blinding pain at 4am because my neighbor wasn’t answering the phone and my boyfriend was in Omaha on business. My appendix was removed some hours later. (Sidebar: If you’re from Philly let me tell you, the ONLY time a SEPTA bus stops at yellow lights is if you’re in horrific pain and it’s 4am on the way to the hospital)</p><p>-For the past EIGHT months I have been having a slight Twitter war with Susan Sarandon. It all started after I replied to one of her tweets about Chicago Deep Dish pizza. (IT’S NOT A PIZZA, SUSAN. IT’S ITS OWN FOOD)</p><p>-My boyfriend and I own a 41’ sailboat that has survived Hurricane Sandy, being struck by lightning<em> two</em> times, and nearly sinking into the Atlantic Ocean. The boat is also named after the former owner’s deceased wife and we are too afraid to change it. Her name is the Lady Sam.</p><h2>MY STYLE:</h2><p>First and foremost <em><a href="https://abigeyedfish.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/buffy-eyebrow-raise.gif?w=250">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a></em><a href="https://abigeyedfish.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/buffy-eyebrow-raise.gif?w=250"> is probably the biggest influence on my writing</a>. If you like Buffy, hopefully you like me.</p><p>Not just the snarky dialogue (which yes that’s there too), but also the darker aspects of Buffy. I also take some of my darker horror elements from Stephen King.</p><p>When I was in third grade I was a bit of a troublemaker. In order to make me pay attention in class my teacher developed this point system. At the end of the week if I got enough points after each lesson, my mother agreed to reward me with anything I wanted.</p><p>One of those times I chose to go to the bookstore and pick out <em>any </em>book I wanted. I chose <em>The Shining</em> by Stephen King.</p><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/aSczP.gif">I was a peculiar child.</a></p><p>That’s when I started writing, by the way. It wasn't all blood and guts back then. In fact, the first short story I ever wrote told the brilliantly original tale of a money tree growing in our backyard. I forget all the magical logistics of growing said money tree (there was a distinct lack of Money Tree Security as well) but it was all in order to help my mother pay the bills. This was met with praise by my teacher and she hung it up in the hallway during Parent/Teacher night.</p><p>My mother maintains that it was the best thing I’ve ever written.</p><p>While it is exceedingly sad to have peaked at such a young age I’ve managed to persevere and continue writing. I am currently a contributor over at <a href="http://horrorfreaknews.com/author/hfncontributorbrown">HorrorFreakNews.com</a> and this is my second year participating in Pitch Wars.</p><p>I like my books to be funny, scary, heartbreaking, surprising, mysterious, and thrilling. Basically the best of every world.</p><h2>MY BOOK:</h2><p>This year I am presenting my YA horror novel: <em>Lovecraft Will Tear Us Apart </em>(title subject to change, the original title was <em>Wendigo Your Own Way </em>but I was told to try something darker).</p><p>Alexandra Aguilar is a typical girl, she has boyfriend troubles, school troubles, her recently deceased father was apparently a serial killer in his spare time, and after being nearly mauled to death by a monster her arm has begun shifting into tentacles. Now Alex, with the help of her best friend Cody, has to solve a new round of murders, clear her father’s name, <em>and</em> deal with these pesky tentacles.</p><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/nQj35ku.gif">It’s one part Buffy...</a></p><p><a href="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3ef14953-a02c-4f6b-8096-5225eb4527f1.gif">One part Veronica Mars...</a></p><p><a href="https://66.media.tumblr.com/f1375f8b24c1eba3cadd3b0799320ca8/tumblr_nqxlmzldfp1tbff57o1_500.gif">And just a dash of Lovecraft...</a></p><p>I wanted to do something different with the “teen-finds-out-there’s-a-secret-world” trope. Buffy was “The Chosen One,” she didn’t have a choice and was basically forced to save the world every week. While that is all fine and dandy for Buffy, I didn’t want that for my character. I wanted her to actually <em>choose </em>this path. Her motivations drive her further into conflict of her own making instead of conflict finding her.</p><p>I would love to be part of Pitch Wars so I can fine-tune and develop my complicated lead character and fill out any plot holes that may arise. The good news is, I take criticism like a champ.</p><p>I went to school for film and focused on writing for media and the most beneficial classes were those where we critiqued each other’s writing. The teacher would cut us off if anyone said:</p><p>“I really liked—”</p><p>“NO! No one cares how you feel. If you want to praise something tell them what <em>works </em>and what <em>doesn’t.”</em></p><p>It was all the best kind of tough love. I’m here to make my book better and I’m willing to work my ass off to do it.</p><h2><strong>The Social Media Shuffle:</strong></h2><p>Feel free to follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/WriterikJB">Twitter</a>: <a href="https://twitter.com/WriterikJB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@WriterikJB</a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/erikjb/">Instagram</a>: ErikJB or on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22960845-erik-brown">Goodreads</a> or <a href="http://scoopempire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/snapchat.gif">Snapchat</a> or <a href="http://i.imgur.com/cocvp.gif">tumblr</a> or <a href="http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/degrassi/images/2/24/Phoebe_stop_the_madness.gif/revision/latest?cb=20140201070335">Google+</a> or even <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=i+don't+know+what+pinterest+is+gif&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi09t_EuIDOAhUM7yYKHRcWDCAQ_AUICCgB&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=643#tbm=isch&amp;q=i+don%27t+have+pinterest+gif">Pinterest.</a> (look closely at those last four...)</p><p>If you want to nerd out with me on some other fun stuff:</p><p><strong>Favorite Books:</strong></p><p>The Shining by Stephen King</p><p>Beloved by Toni Morrison</p><p>To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee</p><p>The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck</p><p>Chaos Walking Trilogy by Patrick Ness</p><p>Olive Kitteridge by Elizabeth Strout</p><p>House of Leaves by Mark Z.
